title:  "What Is Quantum Spin?"
description: "
Quantum spin is something which is not easy to explain. You’d be excused if you explain it as similar to a planet rotating around its axis, but it’s not that. Quantum spin is angular momentum just like the rotating motion of a planet is angular momentum but it’s a purely quantum property.

Quantum spin is something which is not easy to explain in one sentence, but this is definitely NOT what spin is. I need to stress this again: quantum spin is not like a spinning top or like a planet turning on its axis. It's called that for historical reasons because it was believed it is some sort of rotation and it's really unfortunate because it's causing a lot of confusion.

Here's why it's not rotation:

1. A particle such as an electron is point like, which means it's *zero dimensional*. There is nothing to rotate around an axis.

2. Non elementary particles such as protons or neutrons have spin, but they also have a certain size. In the case of a proton, it's made out of three quarks which are held together by gluons, and has a size of approximately 0.85×10<sup>−15</sup>m. But if you think of it as a little sphere, you'd conclude that it's rotating faster than the speed of light, which is a no-no.

### The Basics
So how did the notion of spin came about? Well, in classical electrodynamics, it was know that a rotating charged body produces a magnetic field around it, and the faster the rotation, the bigger this magnetic field (actually called a *magnetic moment*. So a spinning object is behaves like bar magnet (we discussed magnets in the previous post).

But it was also discovered that electrons possess a similar magnetic moment, so in effect an electron is a small point like magnet.

You can see that with the [Stern-Gerlach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern%E2%80%93Gerlach_experiment) experiment:

<br/>

But here's where it gets interesting, there are actually just two possible values for the magnetic moment in regards to any direction: up and down. Nothing in between. This is why we say the spin is quantized. This is also another reason why this spin is not an actual rotation of the electron. But if it would be, spin *up* would correspond to a particle spinning counterclockwise in relation to its direction of movement (we call this a *left handed* electron) and spin down would correspond to a particle rotating clockwise (a *right handed* electron).

Something like this:

Hmm now wait a minute. In 3D space an object can rotate around any axis, not just the  direction of movement. What gives? I've told you, quantum spin is not classical rotation. It's just a measurement outcome and the way to think of it is like an intrinsic property of a particle. The particle is either *left-handed* or *right-handed*. The reason we care is because the [weak force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_interaction) only interacts with left handed particles, which is really weird, but Nature works in mysterious ways.

Also, we only observe left-handed [neutrinos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino) in the Universe.

Another interesting thing is that the mathematics of quantum mechanics tells us that a particle is in a *superposition* of states. It's both left-handed and right-handed at the same time, until you measure it. I don't like that interpretation. I like to think a particle is in neither state, it's in a transitory state (a state of *flux* if you will).

The [measurement problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_problem) in QM is a subject for whole different article, but here's my take on it:

![coin](/images/coin.jpeg){:class="img-responsive"}

You could think of a particle as a spinning coin. It's neither heads nor tails, it's spinning. Say you want to measure if it's heads or tails—it means you have to interact with it, you have to touch it. But the action of interacting with it makes it collapse to one state or the other.

Let's assume an electron goes through a Stern-Gerlach machine and it comes up having spin up in relation to a certain direction in space (the direction the SG machine is pointing in). If the same electron goes through a second machine pointing in the same direction in space as the first one, we are going to get spin up 100% of the time. The first measurement actually collapsed the state of the particle to that concrete value. But if we rotate the second machine just a little bit, we are going to get a percentage smaller than 100% of it being spin up. If the second machine is perpendicular to the first, we actually get 50%-50% so again, we no longer know anything about this particle in that direction.

### Helicity And Chirality
Helicity is simple to explain, it refers to whether the particle is spinning clockwise or counterclockwise. But here's the kicker: particles with mass such as the electron move at a speed smaller than light, so it's theoretically possible to *boost* past them (to overpass them), in which case they will seem to be have the opposite helicity. For particles that move at the speed of light which is the Universe's speed limit, this is not possible.

Chirality is a bit more interesting. It's related to helicity and for massless particles they are the same thing because as I said, helicity doesn't change for particles moving at the speed of light. In general, an object is said to be achiral if its mirror image is identical to itself, and chiral if not. Because a person's left hand is different than the right hand, they are not superimposable on one another, so they are said to be chiral.

![chirality](/images/chirality.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

So why do we care? First of all, because while helicity is *observer dependent*, chirality is not. And as I've said, for some strange reason nature makes a distinction between left handed particles and right handed particles.

*Not only is nature not ambidextrous, it's actually has a preference for left handedness. The Standard Model is a chiral theory, not an achiral one because it makes left-handed particles are treated differently than right-handed particles.*

A chiral particle can be *left-chiral* or *right-chiral* and this property is observer independent, but this is a bit tricky to define because it's a mathematical property which describes how the wavefunction of the particle looks under rotations (which is equivalent to looking at the particle from a different angle). What is interesting is that 1/2 spin particles actually need two full 360 degree rotations to look the same and one rotation makes the wavefunction have the opposite sign (they are said to be anti-symmetric).

### It Actually IS Angular Momentum
Spin is also called *intrinsic angular momentum*, which is really interesting. We discussed that it's not a spinning motion because there's nothing to spin, so why is spin some sort of angular momentum? Well, we DO KNOW that if we bombard a classical sized object with particles with spin -1/2 for example, sure enough that object will eventually start to spin, so quantum spin does have something to do with actual spinning.

But why?

It is believed that what we perceive as "space", is actually some sort of structure emerging from quantum phenomena and not a fundamental concept. One such concept of space is called a *spin network*, as you can see in this image.

Since spin is angular momentum, it's measured in kg·m<sup>2</sup>·s<sup>−1</sup>. But we only see multiples of certain values for this, like so:

![chirality](/images/spinvec.gif){:class="img-responsive"}

For [fermions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion) spin can take values such as -1/2, 1/2, 3/2, 5/2 etc. Since spin is just the projection on the S<sub>z</sub> axis and it is periodic, 3/2 is equivalent to 1/2, 5/2 to -1/2 and so on, so we just have -1/2 and 1/2 as unique possible values which correspond to left and right handedness. [Bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boson) (which are force carrier particles) such as the photon are spin 1 particles, so their spin can only take -1 and 1 as possible values (which makes a world of difference because it means bosons are able to pass through one another unimpeded but prevents matter particles from doing so—the [Pauli exclusion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle), which is why we have planets, people, iPhones and TGI Friday's).

### Conclusion
There's much more to spin than this, for example how the Pauli exclusion principle works, how photons mediate the electromagnetic force, parity violations etc.
