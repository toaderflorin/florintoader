title:  "The Rationale Behind Human Irrationality"
description: "'You do not need science to survive , but you need to survive to do science' Taleb once said, and truer words have never been spoken. So the brain has a caching mechanism. In SHTF situations, making a good enough decision REALLY FAST is better than making the best decision if that takes say a few minutes."

"You do not need science to survive , but you do need to survive to do science" a wise man [once said](https://medium.com/incerto/how-to-be-rational-about-rationality-432e96dd4d1a), and truer words have never been spoken. For you see, in SHTF situations, making a good enough decision REALLY FAST is better than making the best decision if that takes say a few minutes.

*The brain doesn't do backtracking, it's greedy ALL THE WAY.*

If the brain had an architecture, it would be of the [Big Ball Of Mud](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-big-ball-of-mud-and-other-architectural-disasters/) variety.

Finding the best solution involves exploring the whole solution space which is usually an O(n<sup>m</sup>) affair [complexity-wise](https://discrete.gr/complexity/), while greedy algorithms are O(n), and even your average brain consumes a lot of glucose.

### Cargo Cults And Neural Networks
The Mayans thought they had to sacrifice virgins to the gods in order for the sun to continue rising each morning. You or I might look up at the sky, see a cloud and that looks like a guinea pig and think *"how quaint, how'd that sh#t got up there"*.

Regardless, our brains have a tendency to see [agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_(philosophy)) where there is none (from rodent lookalike cumulus to bad omens in medieval times) and it's interesting to think why that came about from an evolutionary perspective.

Beats are not really know for their technical quality or fidelity, but nonetheless, they have a cult following.
