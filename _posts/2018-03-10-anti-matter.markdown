title:  "Special Relativity Requires That Antimatter And Spin Exist"
description: "Antimatter is interesting because it was predicted by Paul Dirac's equation before it was actually discovered in a laboratory and for a while this prediction was actually problematic because no one had actually seen such an exotic form of matter. Heisenberg even went as far as to call Dirac's equation garbage, but considering how strange the quantum world was beginning to look at the turn of the century, he probably should have known better.

If you aren't familiar with special relativity go ahead and have a look at my [article](http://florintoader.net/special-relativity) now--it's something that you absolutely must grasp before delving into subjects like *quantum field theory*. Antimatter is interesting because it was predicted by Paul Dirac's equation before it was actually discovered in a laboratory and for a while this prediction was actually problematic because no one had actually seen such an exotic form of matter. Heisenberg even went as far as to call Dirac's equation garbage, but considering how strange the quantum world was beginning to look at the turn of the century, he probably should have known better.

The story of QFT is interesting: when Schr√∂dinger tried to describe what happens to an electron using his [famous equation](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/53/Schrodinger_Equation.png), he actually tried to make it compatible with Einstein's theory of special relativity but he was not able to and so the equation uses Newtonian concepts of time and space. If we were to try and tweak it and replace the terms with the Lorentzian concepts of time and space that special relativity adheres to, we would get the Klein Gordon equation which has a host of problems: first and foremost, the wave-function *isn't unitary*--integrating (summing up) the function over the whole space doesn't give you 100% probability, which is absurd because the electron has to be *somewhere* with 100% probability. Heck, it's value isn't even constant so you cannot scale it by a factor to get 100%. Second, it doesn't take electron spin into account which is a big problem. Not only do electrons come into two varieties (up and down), they sit at slightly different energy levels in the electron shell.

### The Pauli Equation

And while the Schrodinger/Pauli equations do a pretty good job of predicting the spectral lines of the hydrogen atom, it's obviously not fundamentally correct. It's just an approximation.

Dirac tried the opposite approach: instead of trying to tweak the Schrodinger equation to obey special relativity rules, he postulated there's *another* equation that's *Schrodinger like* in structure and set out to figure out what the parameters are if they were compatible with special relativity. As a quick note, everybody is familiar with <i>E=mc<sup>2</sup></i> but that formula is valid only for non-moving particles--it gives us the *rest mass* of a particle or object in its own frame of reference. Physicists tend to use the *energy-momentum relation* when doing calculations which is <i>E<sup>2</sup>=(pc)<sup>2</sup> + (m<sub>0</sub>c<sup>2</sup>)<sup>2</sup></i> and this is also what Dirac used. He postulated that there is some formula who's parameters obey this relationship.

Dirac soon realized that for that to happen, the coefficients of the equation need to be at a minimum 4&times;4 matrices just as Pauli had used 2&times;2 matrices to model particles with spin which means the wave function now has four scalar components. Two of those components are wave functions for the familiar left and right handed electrons, but what to make of the other two? Moreover, these are the negative energy part of the solution which appear because of the fact that *E* is squared in the energy-momentum relationship.
