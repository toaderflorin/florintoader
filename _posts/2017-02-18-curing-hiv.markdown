It’s always a joy to have a conversation with people who think that AIDS was created by the CIA, and the reason we don’t have a cure is because it’s all a big government conspiracy — you can make fun of them and feel extra smart. But seriously, why is AIDS so hard to cure? I thought I would write an article to explain the hurdles which prevent us from having a vaccine or a functional cure.

First, a bit of history that shows that HIV wasn’t made in the lab. Genetic sequencing of the virus concluded that HIV is a descendant of SIV (Simian Immunodeficiency Virus) and that the first transmission of SIV to HIV in humans took place around 1920 in Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo (yes, the virus crossed over from primates, but interestingly enough, most primate species seem to be unaffected by the virus). The actual AIDS epidemic started in the late ’70s, but it wasn’t recognized as a new disease back then. After an outbreak of various illnesses that were previously very rare like Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia or Kaposi’s Sarcoma among gay men, it was suspected that the culprit might be a yet undiscovered pathogen that affects the immune system. In 1981 alone there were 270 reported cases of this severe immunodeficiency among gay communities. Physicians called it GRID, gay related immune deficiency.

However, after an explosion of cases among hemophiliacs, it soon become clear that anybody is susceptible to get infected, and the name was changed to acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS for short.

To understand why it’s so hard to cure AIDS, I first need to explain it’s mechanism of action, how the immune system works, and how the AIDS virus in particular is different from other viruses. The first thing that one needs to know about viruses is that whereas bacteria are fully fledged microorganisms that are able to replicate themselves (they have ribosomes and are able to perform protein synthesis on their own) and, viruses are essentially just capsules which contain genetic material — DNA or RNA, depending on the virus. So in order to replicate, viruses need to attach to a host cell, inject their own genetic material inside that cell and rely on the protein synthesis mechanism of that cell to create copies. During cell division, the virions are ejected and released into the bloodstream where they attach to other cells.

The HIV virus looks something like the picture from the start of the article and it binds to the CD4 protein of the T helper cells (also called CD4+ T cells). T helper cells are our body’s defense system — they fight infection.

The actual reason why the HIV virus actually destroys T cells was long a mistery. But according to new research, it’s because when T cells get infected, they release chemical inflammation triggers in the bloodstream which attract other T cells, through a process called chemotaxis (chemical attraction). This is a normal process used by the immune system to fight infectious agents, but in the case of HIV it creates a vicious circle: the GD4+T cells gang up on HIV infected cells and kill them, and as a result they can also get infected. In time, the T cells get more and more depleted and the infected individual is susceptible to all sorts of infectious diseases that normally would not be deadly.

So why it’s so hard to cure HIV? There are two reasons:

1. It’s an RNA virus, which means it’s molecule is a lot more chemically unstable than that of a DNA virus, because it only has one strand.
2. Natural virus reservoirs in the body.

DNA is made out of two RNA strands. The nitrogenous bases G, U, A and C that make up the DNA and encode the genetic information are complementary (G attracts U and A attracts C), forming a more rigid structure than you have with RNA. It’s more stable for the same reason why a stool with four legs is more stable than a stool with two legs, in case you are wondering. With DNA, genetic information is sort of backed up(because there are two copies) so it’s a lot harder to get data corruption (mutations).

Number 1 is also the reason we have a Hepatitis B vaccine (it’s a DNA virus), and we don’t have a Hepatitis C vaccine (which is RNA).The virus is simply able to outsmart your typical vaccine.

CD4+T cells are programmed to fight against specific pathogens by being exposed to molecules called antigens, which trigger a differentiation process in these cells. They go from naive T cells to specialized ones. A vaccine works by exposing the body to dead or weakened pathogens which lack the ability to infect, but can still trigger an immune response because they have the respective antigens on the cell membrane (or the virus envelope, in the case of virus). RNA viruses are sneaky — even the body becomes immune to certain version of the virus, the virus population can quickly mutate to become undetectable. The old versions of the virus simply die, and the undetectable ones survive. This presents significant challenges for developing a vaccine for HIV.

And as you can guess, it’s highly effective — a patient on HAART will have essentially undetectable HIV levels in his/her bloodstream (btw, this is why Charlie Sheen’s doctor was willing to have unprotected sex with him, in case you are wondering), but the question is: why isn’t this approach able to eradicate the virus from the body? The simple answer is HIV can be easily eradicated as long as cells divide. The problem is the virus can find it’s way into the nucleus of cells that don’t divide very often, like bones, the lining of the stomach etc. The brain is also a formidable [HIV reservoir](https://www.poz.com/article/brain-reservoir-23545-5827).

What’s also interesting is that when some cells detect changes in their DNA (which to the cell signals potential cancer), the cell division is inhibited to prevent a tumor from forming. Because these cells have a very low replication rate, the virus is able to hide inside these cells indefinitely. So while it’s easy to get HIV counts down to detectable levels, a functional cure has proven elusive.
