*"Opinions are like assholes, everybody's got one"* a wise man once said. That wise man was Larry Flynt, or at least that's what the movie claims he said. Those might not have been his exact words, but no need to get into specifics... you see, smart people have egos. So when Bohr and Heisenberg were working on quantum mechanics at the beginning of the 20th century, they weren't content on just creating a mathematical framework for making predictions, they also claimed that things in quantum mechanics are **inherently random**. In doing so, they not only crossed the boundary between philosophy and physics, they were butting heads with another smart guy who unsurprisingly also had a big ego, and who famously exclaimed *"God doesn't play dice!"*. 

That guy was Einstein.

### A Different Point Of View ###

It turns out however that there are alternative ways of thinking about the randomness factor in QM, so other people came with different ideas. There was Hugh Everett with his [many-worlds interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation), and there was Bohm with his [*pilot have theory*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Broglie%E2%80%93Bohm_theory), which I find especially interesting. Bohm realized that he could come up with a **deterministic and non-local** theory in which a wave of *potential* moves the particles along their path. In the case of the double slit experiment, the wave would go through both slits, but each individual particle only goes through one. The trajectories you get are something like this (which are perfectly consistent with experiment):

It turns out there's actually a real life analogy in walking droplets over vibrating oil baths so we can see quantum-like effects in real life with our own eyes. 

Check out Derek's presentation here:

It's really mind blowing! Not only do these walking droplets reproduce interference patterns in the double slit experiment, but we also get quantum corrals.

What is interesting about the walking droplets experiment is that the particle doesn't need to be in two places at the same time as the standard formalism of QM would have you believe. It's almost like we can get just a little bit of sanity back into the field of fundamental physics. But we can go even further.

Let's first look at a couple of concepts. We know each particle type in our universe has a corresponding antiparticle, the antiparticle of the electron is the positron, for example. Obviously, it goes both ways - the antiparticle of the positron is the electron (by the way, the antiparticle of the up quark is not the down quark, because the up quark has +2/3 electric charge, and the down quark has -1/3 electric charge. It's actually the anti-up quark). Because the photon doesn't have electric charge, it is its own antiparticle. We also know that when a particle collides with its antiparticle, both of them annihilate and they produce energy in the form of high energy gamma rays. But since our universe has a law called **T-symmetry** or *time reversal symmetry*, the reverse is also true so a gamma ray can also spontaneously split into an electron-positron pair, as seen in this Feynman diagram:

![image-title-here](/images/diagram.jpg){:class="img-responsive"} 

We also know that empty space is not really empty because that would violate Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, so there is a minimal amount of jitter when you get close to Planck scale. 

The void actually looks something like this:

![image-title-here](/images/noise.png){:class="img-responsive"} 

From a distance, this image just looks gray, and this is why we perceive space as being "empty". Instead of a bubbling soup of particles, antiparticles and photons, we see... well, just *nothingness*. How do we know empty space is not empty? First, there's the [Casimir effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir_effect), just put to plates close to one another and they will be pushed together because of the pressure of this "empty" space. Then there's [dark energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy), which permeates all space and pushes our universe apart in an accelerated fashion.

### A Toy Universe ###
Let's create a toy universe consisting of just first generation leptopns (electrons and positrons) and energy (photons). We'll leave out the extra junk for now, like second and third generation particles like the muon and tau, the neutrinos, and all baryonic matter (the three quark generations). 

A bunch of stuff happens:

1. A photon can spontaneously split into an electron-positron pair.
2. The electron will attract the positron (because they have opposing charges), and will annihilate, creating a new photon.
3. The electron might actually attract and annihilate another neighboring positron, leaving an unpaired positron, which will end up annihilating with a neighboring unpaired electron. There is always an equal number of positrons and electrons in our toy universe, so there will always be a free pair.

And this just goes on and on, and we get a bunch of [virtual particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_particle) popping in and out of existence perpetually as [quantum fluctuations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_fluctuation).

But here's the deal: our universe is not empty, *it has a slight asymmetry of matter over antimatter*. So let's add an electron to our field, and impart it some momentum. Instead of a bazillion electrons and a bazillion positrons, we are going to have a bazillion + 1 one electron and a bazillion positrons. Here's what's going to happen: our electron is going to bump into a positron, and it's going to annihilate, leaving an unpaired electron which is going to fly off in some direction. This new electron will fly of in some other direction and bump into another positron etc. 

What you get is something like [Newton's cradle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_cradle):

![image-title-here](/images/newton.gif){:class="img-responsive"} 

which is pretty much equivalent to the propagation of the wave function from the previous article:

![image-title-here](/images/wave.gif){:class="img-responsive"} 

...but instead of a wave propagating in one dimension, it propagates in multiple dimensions (two in our toy universe, three in the universe we live in because there are three spatial dimensions etc.). It's not really that much different than a sound wave propagating through a medium. 

So what exactly does this have to do with the walking droplets experiment? The systems are quite similar in behavior - and they both show that systems which make sense from the classical point of view can reproduce quantum effects. In the walkers experiment, the integrity of the droplets is ensured by a small film of air between the oil bath and the particle itself. In our toy experiment, individual particles are ensured by the fact the field is quantized - you cannot find half a particle. But even the notion of *what path does my particle take* is pointless, because the notion of *my particle* doesn't make any sense. The particle disappears almost instantly, and *a new particle* takes it's place - particles in quantum field theory are indistinguishable from one another. What you do care is that there is a ripple traveling through a field (space), and that this field is quantized (you can never find half an electron, only a full electron), and that our universe has a slight asymmetry of matter over antimatter. Here's another thing:

*You can never detect absolutes, you detect only differences between values.*

You detect the speed of an object in relation to the speed of another object. In the case of the Casimir effect, you detect *the difference* in pressure between the metal plates, not the absolute pressure of the quantum void. Same with matter - we just perceive the stable ripples in the fields, like you can see in the the first ever photo of a hydrogen atom, woohoo!

![image-title-here](/images/hydrogen.jpg){:class="img-responsive"} 

An orbital is *not the trajectory of a single electron* around the nucleus of an atom, it's a region of space where the number of electrons is exactly one more when compared to the number of positrons. It's simply the area where the wave in our field around the positively reinforces. The other fluctuations cancel each other out so we don't see them! So why is there one and only electron difference in that area of space? Awesome question. Because electrons are both negatively charged, they repel each other - so you are never going to have to waves of fermions on top of each other adding up constructively, like you can with photons. This is the Pauli exclusion principle, check [it out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle). 

How do electrons repel? By exchanging photos - to be more precise by creating ripples in the photon field which couples with the electron field, but that's for another article.
