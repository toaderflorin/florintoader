title:  "Erwin, How's That Cat Of Yours Doing?"
description: "
Quantum spin is something which is not easy to explain. You’d be excused if you explain it as similar to a planet rotating around its axis, but it’s not that. Quantum spin is angular momentum just like the rotating motion of a planet is angular momentum but it’s a purely quantum property.

You might have heard of a little thought experiment by Schrodinger in trying to prove the absurdity of the [Copenhagen interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_interpretation) of quantum mechanics.

Here's a description of the experiment by the man himself:

<i>
One can even set up quite ridiculous cases. A cat is penned up in a steel chamber, along with the following device (which must be secured against direct interference by the cat): in a Geiger counter, there is a tiny bit of radioactive substance, so small, that perhaps in the course of the hour one of the atoms decays, but also, with equal probability, perhaps none; if it happens, the counter tube discharges and through a relay releases a hammer that shatters a small flask of hydrocyanic acid. If one has left this entire system to itself for an hour, one would say that the cat still lives if meanwhile no atom has decayed. The first atomic decay would have poisoned it. The psi-function of the entire system would express this by having in it the living and dead cat (pardon the expression) mixed or smeared out in equal parts.
</i>

Essentially, you could write something like:

which gives equal probability amplitudes to the cat being dead or alive, and these amplitudes add up to 100%. He further goes on to say:

<i>
It is typical of these cases that an indeterminacy originally restricted to the atomic domain becomes transformed into macroscopic indeterminacy, which can then be resolved by direct observation. That prevents us from so naively accepting as valid a "blurred model" for representing reality. In itself, it would not embody anything unclear or contradictory. There is a difference between a shaky or out-of-focus photograph and a snapshot of clouds and fog banks. 
</i>

Before we discuss this in detail, we must understand some basic aspects of quantum mechanics. One aspect is *coherence*. In a coherent light source like a laser, all photons have the same wave-length, and their phases are synchronized, and it looks like this:

A decoherent light source would look like this:

![magnetic field](/images/decoherent.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

But we know that not just light, but all matter particles are waves. And if you take a big object, which is made out of many particles, that object will be made out of a lot of wavy-things (the particles) and their phases and wavelengths will be out of sync. This is why you don't see quantum behavior for large objects.

### The Measurement Problem
In quantum mechanics, the wave function describes the probability of finding the particle in a location in space, but to actually figure out where it is, you have to perform a measurement. After the measurement, the wavefunction will start to spread again.

Since the measurement is giving you a precise location, the wavefunction is said to *collapse*, because as you can see, the wavefunction takes a very specific value. 

When you measure something, you have to interact with that thing. That's not exactly news. But here's the deal: *Normally, the measuring device is much bigger than what it measures. Just think of a thermometer you are using to take your temperature when you have a fever.*  When you measure temperature, both the measured body and the thermometer tip reach *thermal equilibrium*, but since the thermometer is much smaller than the object it measures, this temperature is very close to the initial temperature of the object. But in the case of quantum systems, the actual apparatus that does the measuring is much bigger than what it measures, so it would be reasonable to ask if it plays any role in the actual measurement result. There's a little interesting caveat to measuring the state of quantum objects: *you can tweak the precision of the measurement*. In the case of the double slit experiment, you could place a detector on one of the slits in order to figure out if the particle has went through that path. But in this particular case, determining with 100% certainty that the particle has gone through one slit or the other makes the interference pattern disappear. 

In the case of quantum systems, measurement means entanglement with the measuring apparatus, and we know that BIG, non-quantum systems don't manifest the wavy behavior of small system because of decoherence. Since a cat can be either dead or alive, and since measuring something means entangling it with a big system, could it be that the act of measuring collapses the state from something wavy to something definite?
