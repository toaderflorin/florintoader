title:  "Particles Are Not Really Particles"
description: "Antimatter is interesting because it was predicted by Paul Dirac's equation before it was actually discovered in a laboratory and for a while this prediction was actually problematic because no one had actually seen such an exotic form of matter.

We've all been around a campfire at night and we've all watched incandescent embers fly up into the night sky. It's strangly relaxing, we also understand how these work. When people think about particles, they think about something like this, or things like speeding bullets etc. It's intuitive, the way they work is easy to understand.

Most people that are into physics have heard about Heisenberg's uncertainty principle which says that we cannot know both the position and speed of a particle simultaneously and that particles can be in multiple places at the same time and other such weird things. Feynmann famously said that if you think you understand quantum mechanics you don't really understand quantum mechanics, but is that really so?

*The truth is we have multiple explanations about what quantum mechanics means and we cannot agree on one.*

There isn't anything particularly surprising about Heisenberg's principle because waves don't have an exact location in time, they are spread somewhat.
Imagine you drop a pebble into a pool. The more localized the wave is, the taller/deeper the peaks and throghs are and viceversa.

The momentum wavefunction happens to be the [Fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform) of the position wavefunction, so this happens to work out quite nicely.

This isn't particularly weird. QM actually became weird when Born suggested we can use this wavefunction to calculate probability. In this particular example, the wavefunction gets the location as an input parameter and returns a complex number and it must be unitary and square integrable because obviously we want to get a real number for probabilities and it must be exactly 1 over the whole space.
