One of the confusing things of QM for most people is the idea that a particle is in multiple states at the same time. You can thank Niels Bohr and the Copenhagen interpretation for that —but that’s just a mathematical trick to match theory predictions with experimental outcomes.

*But just because your mathematical trick approximates an outcome, it doesn’t mean that’s what’s really going on. You can simulate the flow of water with smooth mathematical functions, but water is made out of atoms.*

The truth is, we don’t really know what’s going on at the particle level but I like to think of it this way: the particle is not in multiple states at the same time, it’s in a state of flow, so it’s in neither. Think of a spinning coin.

In order to figure out if the coin is heads or tails, you have to interact with it. You have to “touch” it — this will cause it to fall on the surface of the table in either position. The same thing happens to particles — in order to figure out their state, you have to make them interact with a BIG measuring apparatus (by the particle’s standards, anyway), which couples the state of the particle with the state of the measuring device. This collapses the state of the particle in a similar way touching a spinning coin would make it fall flat on the desk.

So how about those weird “probability clouds” around the nucleus called orbitals? I believe I have a simple and intuitive explanation for that. First check this out:

This is what empty space looks like. “Empty” space is not really empty, particles and anti-particles pop in and out of existence all the time, it’s more like a boiling soup of stuff. But these particles are very quickly annihilated by their corresponding anti-particles, so their existence is so brief, we cannot really see them, so they are virtual particles. One more interesting thing:

*Our universe has a very very tiny asymmetry. It has an excess of matter over anti-matter.*

We don’t know why, but we wouldn’t be here if that wouldn’t be the case — so that could be an explanation in and of itself. Maybe it’s the anthropic principle at play? By that I mean there are a multitude of universes out there, and this one has just the right balance of matter to anti-matter so that life occurs and we can ask ourselves why the laws of physics are the way they are.

If you think about the behavior of a particular electron, it doesn’t make sense to try to figure out what our electron is doing because there is no our electron. Electrons interact with positrons (anti-electrons) constantly and they annihilate as a result, releasing energy. That energy (which is just photons!) creates a lot of other particles, including positrons and electrons and so forth, which in turn again annihilate, so empty space is just a jittery soup of particles. Particles pop in and out of existence all the time!

*So an orbital is just an area of space where there is an excess of one electron at any time. There are a bazillion positrons and a bazillion + 1 electrons there, if you will.*

If you are curious why the orbitals have the shapes that they do, read my other article.

And we just got the the concept of a quantum field.
