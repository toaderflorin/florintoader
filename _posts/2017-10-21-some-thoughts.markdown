I've noticed this [article](https://www.quantamagazine.org/pilot-wave-theory-gains-experimental-support-20160516/) on Quanta Magazine and have some thoughts on it. I've always been a proponent of the Bohmian view of QM and I've even gone further in giving an [explanation](http://florintoader.net/particles) to what might constitute the "guiding wave" of the theory−the actual vacuum energy itself.

The argument against the Bohmian view of the world is it's non-locality (which says an object here can have instantaneous effect on something on the other side of the Universe, theoretically), but let us not forget that QM **actually is** nonlocal. Ads spaces looks like *Escher's Circle Limit*, and the AdS-CFT correspondence tells us that a normal quantum field theory in N dimensions corresponds to a quantum-gravity theory in N+1 dimensions, which might be just a mathematical trick, but since it's a realization of the holographic principle, it's a very uncanny discovery.

The *Ads-MERA* approach tries to explain space as a large entanglement network, and it remains to be seen if it's correct or not, but exponential spaces look very similar to the tensor networks MERA is based upon.

What we do know is that [holography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle) is pretty much an established fact about our universe, and [anti-de Sitter spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-de_Sitter_space) which are involved in the the [Ads-CFT correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdS/CFT_correspondence) look a lot like MERA networks (which describe entanglement relations), so this is a really promising line of research.

And since:

1. Entanglement is nonlocal.
2. Bohmian mechanics are also nonlocal but allows as to make rational sense of the world.
3. The actual pilot wave is the vacuum energy, as I've argued [here](http://florintoader.net/particles).

we can think of this nonlocality as an asset, not a problem of the Bohmian view of the world.

Exciting times ahead!
