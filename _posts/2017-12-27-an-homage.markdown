No, he's not dead--actually that's the thing and I've been thinking... People are strange animals. We neglect those around us who give use attention an love and chase the ones that don't reciprocate. Actually, someone asked the Dalai Lama what surprises him the most about the world we live in and he reportedly said:

*Man. Because he sacrifices his health in order to make money. Then he sacrifices money to recuperate his health. And then he is so anxious about the future that he does not enjoy the present; the result being that he does not live in the present or the future; he lives as if he is never going to die, and then dies having never really lived.*

Our generation discovered what a [guitar virtuoso](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4i7gO7pQ_8) and awesome artist Prince was after he died. Same with George Michael. John Williams is 85, and I hate to say this, but he might not be with us much longer. Let us all celebrate him and cherish his body of work as well as what he is still putting out.

As far as I am concerned, he is better than Beethoven. Two hundred years from now people will look back at his work and wonder what it would have been to be contemporary with him and see him conduct a concert.

Enjoy.
