description: "No, he's not dead, actually that's the thing-I've been thinking... people are strange beings. We neglect those around us who give use attention an love and chase the ones that don't reciprocate. Our generation discovered what a guitar virtuoso and  awesome artist Prince was after he died. Same with George Michael.

No, he's not dead, actually that's the thing--I've been thinking... people are strange beings. We neglect those around us who give use attention an love and chase the ones that don't reciprocate. Our generation discovered what a [guitar virtuoso](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4i7gO7pQ_8) and awesome artist Prince was after he died. Same with George Michael. John Williams is 85, and I hate to say this, but he might not be with us much longer. Let us all celebrate him and cherish his body of work as well as what he is still putting out.

As far as I am concerned, he is better than Beethoven. Two hundred years from now people will look back at his work and wonder what it would have been to be contemporary with him and see him conduct a concert.

Enjoy.
