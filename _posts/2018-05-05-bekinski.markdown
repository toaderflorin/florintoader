Zdzisław Beksiński was an interesting fellow. His work is grim, eerie, but also incredibly mesmerising. People that knew him personally, claimed he was one of the most friendly and positive persons they've met, which you probably might not able to tell based on the subjects he chose for his paintings.

All of his works are unnamed.
