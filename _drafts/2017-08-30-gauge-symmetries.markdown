The normal rules of physics don't apply to the quantum world, but I guess you already knew that. One example of this is particles going through small potential barriers without having the energy to do so, like in this example.

The wave function of the particle hitting the obstacle looks like this:

As you can see, most of the wave reflects back, but a part of it goes through, so there is a *probability* the particle crosses the barrier. But what would you say if I would tell you that there isn’t such a thing as energy conservation? Actually, energy isn’t a real physical thing, it’s a mathematical gimmick. It's actually a byproduct of the *T  symmetry* of the laws of physics; we'll get to that in a bit.

### A Primer On Calculus ###
Here’s the deal: when Newton figured out the moon orbiting around the Earth, and objects falling on Earth have the same cause, he didn’t have a computer to do computations with, so he invented calculus — which is just derivatives and integrals.

![image-title-here](/images/derint.gif){:class="img-responsive"} 

Integrals are an analytical way of summing stuff up. Derivatives give you the variation of a function and integrals are the opposite of derivatives. Which is to say:

1. Speed is the variation of the position of an object in relation to time — you can get the speed of the object at any point in time if you know it’s position, by differentiating it in relation to time.

2. Alternatively, you can get the position of the object at any time, if you know the speed at all times, by integrating or summing up the speed.

So if you are trying to figure out what objects are doing, you are going to work a lot with functions and their derivatives and integrals — this is just basic calculus. Let’s consider a specific problem: throwing a rock into the air at a specific angle. Now, there’s a number of questions we could ask: where is the rock at moment t, how high will the rock get into the air, how far away from the thrower will the rock land etc. At the end of the day, we can ask time dependent questions or time-independent questions and we get the answer to time-independent questions by integrating time-dependent physical laws in relation to time (see lagrangian mechanics versus hamiltonian mechanics). 


### God's Not Up There Counting ###

So what does this have to do with energy? Various energy calculation formulas are just a time independent formulations of different things: kinetic energy is the integral of momentum.

*Energy is just a mathematical gimmick, it’s not a real physical thing. It’s simply a sum.*

*The law of conservation of eneregy* just says this sum stays constant over a period of time in BIG (non-quantum) systems. Small quantum systems violate energy conservation laws ALL THE TIME. In fact, let’s have a look at the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: 

![image-title-here](/images/heisenberg.gif){:class="img-responsive"} 

In a nutshell, it tells us that we cannot know both the position and the speed of a particle with arbitrary precision, but if we tweak the mathematics around a little bit we get the time-energy uncertainty relation which is mathematically equivalent but says:

*...particles can violate the law of energy conservation, but the more they violate this law the less stable the particle is.*

That’s interesting and **very weird**, but it turns out there would be a way to understand it that makes logical sense, because quantum mechanics is inherently **random**. Let me use an analogy: let’s say we he have a physical system consisting of two players, and each of them starts out with $100. They toss a coin and if it’s heads, player A gives player B $1, and if it’s tails, vice-versa. If this coin would be a perfectly symmetric coin 50%-50% (most real coins are not), the game could theoretically go on forever with both player hovering around $100, give or take — so we can say their money is conserved. Now if the coin is biased on the other hand, meaning there is a slight asymmetry, one player would start to gain money over time while the other would lose over the long term. The bigger the asymmetry of the coin, the faster the game would be over, the players would each be on their own merry way and our physical system will disintegrate. Nobody's up there counting and saying "hey, we got 3 heads in a row, it's time for tails". It's just random, only the repartition is 50%-50%. Same with energy.

So here’s the deal:

*Particles that violate symmetries pop up all the time from the quantum foam, but BECAUSE they violate these symmetries, they are not stable for long enough for us to see them.*

Here’s another simple example of symmetry: the nucleus of an atom and its electron shell have exactly the same electric charge, but with opposite signs. If this wouldn’t be the case, the atom wouldn’t be stable — it would attract enough electrons until the net charge balances out. So what’s the takeaway here?

*Asymmetric states are not stable, they are transitory.*

“Empty space” is not empty, it’s full of virtual particles. Things like quarks, electrons, neutrinos with variable masses, electromagnetic and color (see quantum chromodynamics) charges etc. pop in and out of existence all the time as quantum fluctuations.
And for elementary particles like quarks, electrons etc., these states are so fleeting, they cannot even be observed — this is why these particles are called virtual.

Think of it this way...

![image-title-here](/images/butterfly.png){:class="img-responsive"} 

There’s no law that says butterflies (or any species for that matter) have to be symmetric, but evolution weeds out asymmetric individuals pretty fast. Same with particles, so it's almost like we are dealing with some sort of universal natural selection. Symmetry and harmony go hand in hand, and I've discussed the concept of harmony in physics at length.

And we can actually go further then energy and generalize this concept. In fact there is even a mathematical theorem called *Noether's theorem* which says:

*Every differentiable symmetry of the action of a physical system has a corresponding conservation law.*

Let's see what that means. First of all, a symmetry refers to the property of an object to be *invariant under a transformation*. One example of that would be a sphere: if you take any sphere and you rotate it by any number of degrees in any direction, it will look the same — that's what *invariant* means. And in our case, the action was rotation, but it can be something else like translation or reversing the direction of a spatial or time coordinate. The butterfly in the picture has *mirror symmetry*, meaning we can flip the direction of the y axis and it looks the same etc. 

### Gauge Symmetries ###

By looking at the [Euler-Lagrange equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Lagrange_equation), we can see that:

1. The law of conservation of energy is a consequence of the fact that the Lagrangian doesn't depend on *t*. This means that the laws of physics don't change with time.

2. The conservation of momentum is a consequence of the fact the Lagrangian is invariant under spatial translations. The laws of physics are the same both here and on the moon.

3. The conservation of angular momentum is a consequence of the rotational symmetry of the Lagrangian. And so on...

But there's also a slew of other very interesting symmetries. *T Symmetry* or *time reversal symmetry*, for example, says that if we flip the direction of the arrow of time, we get the same laws, which is really interesting because time seems to be flowing forward, we seem to be getting irreversibly old etc. (but this is for another article). *C Symmetry* or *charge conjugation* tells us that if we flip the sign of the charge of something around, it doesn't make any difference. Indeed, if our world would be made out of anti-particles instead of particles, we wouldn't notice any difference — keep in mind that the electro-weak interaction violates C symmetry, but that's a more advanced topic. *P Symmetry*, *parity*  or mirror symmetry is the property of a system that says it's laws don't change if we flip the sign of a spatial coordinate. Weak interactions also violate this symmetry.

You can also combine these symmetries — for example CP symmetry refers to *both* C symmetry and parity in conjunction, which means that reversing that charge of the particles and mirroring the system spatially should give us the same thing. This was introduced because the weak interaction violated both C and P symmetries, but it turns out that it also [violates CP symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP_violation). What is needed to describe the weak force is [CPT symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPT_symmetryx): you get this by also adding T symmetry to the mix.

So how do we know which interactions obey what symmetries and which not, if everything is so random in quantum mechanics? The same way we would find out if a coin is biased or not. But instead of tossing the coin a gazzilion time and counting the results, we smash things at high speeds a gazzilion times, we sift through the debris and we plot the results on curves and see what comes out.

Now the million dollar question is *if the universe started from a single symmetric point, where does all this variance and uninformity we see in the world around us come from?* 

Stay tuned.
