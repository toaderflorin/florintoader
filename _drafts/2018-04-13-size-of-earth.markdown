title:  "How Did Eratosthenes Figure Out The Size Of The Earth?"
description: "Turns out people knew the Earth was round for quite some time because not only are the other heavenly bodies like the Moon and Sun round, but it turns out you can actually see the Earth's shadow projected on the Moon during a partial Moon eclipse. And it's round. So naturally it has to have a certain size which at least in principle could have been determined.

Turns out people knew the Earth was round for quite some time because not only are the other heavenly bodies like the Moon and Sun round, but it turns out you can actually see the Earth's shadow projected on the Moon during a partial Moon eclipse -- so naturally it has to have a certain size, which at least in principle could have been determined. And this was first done by none other than Eratosthenes of, you know, the *sieve of Eratosthenes* fame.

Legend has it there was a very deep well in Syene, Ancient Egypt, in which the sun shone all the way to the bottom during summer solstice. On hearing this, Eratosthenes immediately recognized that Syene is on or close to a special line (or *parallel*) on Earth, because the Sun usually crosses the sky at an angle, not directly above. This is what a photograph tracing the Sun's path using a year long exposure time (taken with a pinhole camera) looks like:

Sticking a rod (or plain old stick) perpendicular in any flat surface would also work as a gnomon -- as we discussed, in most places on earth the shadow never fully vanishes because the Sun is never directly above the rod, but you know it's noon when the shadow is at its shortest. Comparing the size of the shadow to the size of the stick, Eratosthenes figured that the incident angle of sunlight was about 1 / 50 of a circle, so 7.2 degrees. He also assumed the Sun is at a distance much bigger that the size of the Earth and approximated that the light rays arrive parallel in Alexandria and Syene.

The distance between the two cities is approximately 800 km, which multiplied by 50 gives us a circumference of 40,000 km, which is very close to the 40,075km circumference of the Earth around the equator.

So simple and accurate!
