title:  "Information IS Chaos"
description: "Riddle me this: which image do you think has more information, the one on the left or the one or the right?
If you guessed the one on the left, you were correct. Please note I am not talking about *useful information* (as in useful to humans), I was talking about pure information.

Riddle me this: which image do you think has more information, this one?

![image-title-here](/images/horse.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Or this one?

![image-title-here](/images/noise.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

*Hint: it's a bit counter intuitive.*

If you guessed the first one, you were wrong. Please note I am not talking about *useful information* (as in useful to us humans), I was talking about pure information as in bits.

## A Primer On Entropy ##
When scientists were trying to figure out what heat is, they initially envisioned it as some sort of fluid that can flow between warm objects (possessing this fluid) and cold objects , or warm parts of an object to cooler parts until the "pressure" of this fluid equalizes. Eventually they settled upon the idea that heat is actually an internal jittering motion of the constituents of matter.
