If you look at the world around you, you see stuff. People, cars, trees, building. Everything is similar, YET also slightly different. No two people are 100% percent alike, even identical twins aren't identical - only their DNA is. Have you wondered where all this stuff, for lack of a better word, comes from?

### A Bit Of History
When Einstein developed his general theory of relativity, he discovered something interesting. The universe wasn't static -- it either had to expand or contract, which he tought was at odds with the commonly accepted idea that the universe must have existed forever and must be in a steady state. So what he did was he came up with this idea of a [cosmological constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant) which plugged into the maths, would correct this "problem".

But the problem persisted. When the Hubble telescope looked at galaxies, it found something interesting: *the further away a galaxy is from us, the bigger its red-shift is, meaning the faster it's moving away*, which was a really interesting. Since the idea that the Earth is the center of the universe was given up a long time ago, it was concluded that the universe streches as a whole and galaxies are like raisins on top of an inflating bread. As the bread bakes and stretches, the distance between the raisins increases. Which means if you plot this expansion backwards in time, it means that at some point the universe *might* have arisen from a single point. I stress might, because this is highly speculative. Moreover, it was discovered that not only the galaxies are moving away, they are **accelerating**.

In XXX, it was discovered that everywhere you point an antena, there is a *hissing* noise.

*This radiation is consistent with a warm body of a temperature of 3 degrees Kelvin. And it comes from everywhere in space.*

So it was concluded that at some point, the matter density was so great that the universe was an opaque soup of particles.
