I've given a brief introduction to Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity [here](http://florintoader.net/special-relativity) and to the concept of [Lorentz invariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_covariance) (the actual technical term is *covariance*), which is the property of the speed of light to have the same speed regardless of the speed of the observer.

Yes, it's really weird, but it has to be true.

### Why?
Well, our day to day reality is mostly governed by the the electromagnetic force (and gravity, but that's part of the General Theory of Relativity, and the subject of another discussion). I will show why either electromagnetism is wrong (and it's not, because if you are reading this, it means your phone / device from which you're reading this is still working, the molecules that make up your body are holding together etc.), or Einstein must be right and Newton must be wrong.

Okay, enough for an introduction, let's get our hands dirty. Imagine an electric current in a metal wire:

The electrons are moving at a speed, say *v* (which is much smaller than the speed of light, by the way). Now imagine a stationary charged object like a tiny ball sitting next to the wire. Since the wire is electrically neutral, nothing will happen. But if the ball starts moving along the wire, it's going to be affected by the field and it will be repelled if the charge of the particle is positive, or attracted if it's negative.

*Hmm, that's weird. The number of electrons and the number of protons is the same in the wire.*

Or is it? Let's "strap a camera" on the ball and look at things from its point of reference. Also, let's assume the ball is negatively charged and it's moving at *v*, the speed of the electron (for the sake of simplicity). 

So we have two frames of reference:

1. frame A where the ball is moving, the wire is stationary (so the protons are stationary) and the electrons are moving.

2. frame B (the ball's frame), where the ball is stationary, the and the electric current seems to be moving in the other direction. In this frame, the electrons are stationary, and the protons are moving the other way.

If we look at the two frames of reference from Newton or Galileo's perspective on relativity, we won't see anything special. Sure, the current appears to be moving in the other direction, but that's like overpassing a car on the freeway at a higher speed. To us it appears we are stationary and the car is moving backwards. No big deal, the wire is still neutral when it comes to net elecric charge and it shouldn't affect the ball in any way. And this is the problem, we know from experiments that it should!

Here's a quick refresher of relativity before Einstein:

Pretty straight forward, the speeds just combine intuitively. The problem is this doesn't work for electromagnetism.

Now let's test Einstein's hypothesis that space contracts for moving objects. In the frame B, the distance between the positive charges (the metal atom nuclei that forms) actually contracts because now they are moving (just like special relativity tells us) and the distance between electron actually dilates relative to what it was in frame A. Wait, what? Special relativity doesn't say that distances contract! That's a good spot, but they were contracted in frame A because they were moving and now since they are no longer moving in frame B we no longer have any contraction, so we have a *relative dilation*. So these two effects actually add up and reinforce each other, and it means that to the moving ball the wire appears to have *a net positive charge*.

### The Unification Of Electric And Magnetic Forces
Before Maxwell and Einstein came along, people knew there were aware there are magnetic phenomena (like magnets attracting/repelling each other) and electric phenomena like lightning and electricty (which was thought to be some kind of fluid) where opposite charges attract and same charges repel, but they were thought to be totally unrelated things.

But then people started playing around with the two and they found something interesting. If you run current through a wire, it actually starts to behave like a magnet, and it will interact with other magnets or with feromagnetic materials such as iron.

*A coil is an electromagnet. But it will stop being one the moment we stop running current through it.*

Hmm, weird... So a moving electric charge produces a magnetic field, but a stationary charge doesn't. A stationary charge does have an electric field though. Maxwell looked did a bunch of experiments and figured out that a variable electric field generates a variable magnetic field and *viceversa*. Which means they propagate through space like a ripple and must be in some ways related:

Remember the moving negatively charged ball and wire example? Well, in our (and the wire's) frame of reference, we attribute the attraction force to the wire being an electromagnet, so to the magnetic force. But in the ball's frame of reference the force seems to be because of the electric force, because the wire appears to have a net positively charge. Turns out it's the same thing! The electric and magnetic forces are just sides of the same coin, the electromagnetic force. If you look at it from one point of view it appears as magnetism, if you look at it from a different point of view it appears as an electric force. From yet another point of view, it's a mixture of both. In space, the forces are just perpendicular arrows to one another.

Which might leave you scratching your head a little bit: *well there surely isn't any current flowing through magnetite rocks or refrigirator magnets, now is there?...*

The answer is quite simple, in a magnetic material, the chemical structure makes it so that the spins of the electrons are aligned. Since each electron behaves like a little magnet, all these effects add up and become detectable at big scales.

### One More Thing...
You might be wondering: *why is the wire neutral in it's own frame of reference but not in the frame of the electrons?* 

In other words, why is that frame of reference special? Actually the answer is simple: for the same reason the Earth moves around the Sun and not viceversa. Let me explain: when we think of moving object, we think of their position as the position of their center of mass. For example, we equate the position of our solar system in the galaxy to position of the Sun, because it's so much bigger than everything else and contains most of the mass. 

Well, it's the same with matter, most of it's mass comes from the nucleus.

Nature wants to move to its lowest stable energy state so atoms and molecules tend to be electrically neutral (whenever things are not electrically neutral, we usually have a chemical reaction that brings that system to that state, the ground state). But we noticed that the actual net charge depends on reference frame, so in relation to which does nature pick to be neutral in the case of an atom? In relation to the center of mass obviously, which coresponds to the position of the nucleus. In our wire, the nuclei of the atoms are stationary relative to one another and only the electrons are moving, so that's our prefered frame of reference where the net electric charge is zero.
