If you ask a physicist what the Higgs boson is or if you read up on Wikipedia, you are going to get an answer like: 'The Higgs field is a scalar enegy field that permeats all space which is involved in the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the electro-weak symmetry. The Higgs is the field's correpsonding particle — it's an excitation of that field.' Gee, thanks...

If you ask a physicist what the *Higgs boson* is or if you read up on Wikipedia, you are going to get an answer like: "The Higgs field is a scalar enegy field that permeats all space which is involved in the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the electro-weak symmetry. The Higgs is the field's correpsonding particle — it's an excitation of that field." Gee, thanks. Alternatively, you get an answer which says "it's like molasses", it slows particles down and thus it gives everything mass, which is not exactly true either.

So what is it? Well, it's an energy field but then again all quantum fields are energy fields. Then what is a field? Umm, well this is field:

It's a field of corn. 

An electron field is a field of electrons, duh. The Higgs field is a field of Higgs bosons. And so forth. Since the field is quantized, it means you only find entire electrons, never electron halves or whatever. You also never find half a Higgs. Now, you could find an electron that is *virtual* which is still an electron but the waveform in the field is not stable. Actually, you won't be able to find it, that's why it's called virtual, but enough with the smart-assery (bottom line is, we know they are there). OK so what's that whole *excitation in a quantum field* bit? We discussed what a quantum field is so what is an excitation? It's just an area of the field where it vibrates at an energy level above the ground state of the field (which is what the vacuum state is — vacuum energy is not zero, by the way). 

The Higgs field is actually a *tachyonic field* and has imaginary mass — if you're struggling to get your head around it, think of it this way: "mass" and "energy" are nothing than mathematical gimmicks anyway, and imaginary mass means the field is unstable. They are tools for us to make predictions, don't take them too literaly. The field also has an interesting property: it's ground state is actually at non-zero value, and what we see is a **condensate**. It's a bit like water — if you keep it in a container below zero degrees, it's going to be liquid but the moment you open the lid, it's going to expand out and freeze. We way the water underwent a phase transition and lowered its energy to a more stable level. This is what I meant by the field being unstable.

When hot water vapor hits a cold surface such as glass, it creates condensation droplets. This is another example of phase transition, this time between gas and liquid, not liquid to solid.

The same thing happened to the Higgs. At some point after the Big Bang when the Universe expanded and became cooler, the field underwent a [phase transition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_transition) (the process is called [tachyon condensation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachyon_condensation)) and became somewhat opaque to other particle fields.

### So How Does It Generate Mass?
First things first: the Higgs field only generates a small portion of your mass. The vast majority of the mass of objects comes from the binding energy that keeps the quarks together in the nucleons. It is estimated that the actual rest mass of the quarks is just about 10% of the proton mass and the rest comes from the energy of the gluon field (as per E=mc2), but it's really hard to say because no quarks have been detected isolated from one another. What the Higgs field does is it gives *initial mass* to particles and makes them go at speeds lower than the speed of light. 

OK, so what is mass? I will start of with what mass isn't. Mass doesn't have anything to do with gravity, *energy does*. You could put a high energy gamma ray (photon) in a box with mirrored walls, have it bounce for eternity and you will see the weight of the box is the initial weight PLUS a little bit extra that we get by dividing the energy of the photon by c squared.

*It's actually entirely possible to make black holes out of light. And if we would be able to produce photons energetic enough that their wave-length would be the size of Planck length (which would require a circular accelerator the size of the galaxy), we would have mini blackholes.*.

And we have absolutely no ideea how would those things would behave, but that's why it's so important to come up with a theory of quantum gravity. But I haven't told you what it is: *mass is confined energy.* It's also a measure of inertia. You see, all particles move at the speed of light, it's just that "they bump" into the Higgs and they end up taking a longer route. Just like light moves slower in water because it's going to be scattered by water molecules.

Here's what a low mass interaction would look like:

### Nature Is Really Weird

What does *bumping into the Higgs* mean? Glad you asked, we are about to get technical. Actually there's no bumbing into any Higgs boson here, those Higgses are much too massive to be popping around everywhich way. What happens is the field actually contains *weak hypercharge* (you know, that thing related to the weak interaction), so it couples with . 

So we have our own electron going about its merry way at the speed of light. Our electron is *left handed*, meaning its spin is oriented counter-clockwise in relation to its direction of movement.

![image-title-here](/images/handedness.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Since the electron field interacts with the Higgs field which contains *weak hypercharge* . So our electron is going to "eat" one full unit of spin and it's going to flip from left-handed to right-handed (it goes from -1/2 to 1/2). This right handed 

Why? Because for some reason it seems to diferentiate between left handedness and right handedness. Only left handed particles interact with the weak force bosons (the W and Z), and for these particles it seems that particles spinning clockwise don't even exist! This is called **Parity violation**.
