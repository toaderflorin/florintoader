Here's an interesting conundrum: *if there wasn't any time and any matter before the Big Bang what exactly banged and what exactly caused this bang?* But this question is not new. People have been asking this question for eons in a rather different form: *Why is there something rather than nothing, and why is it that what it is is the way it is and not different?*

In the past, that question was answered simply by postulating God created us. And I am sure there were a lot of smart people that assumed that if that's true, who or what created God. *Does God have a God? And If so, who created God's God?*

But of course, they we're not allowed to ask that question, and least not publicly.

### Turtles All The Way Down? ###

Einstein famously said that one cannot solve a problem thinking on the same level that lead to that problem. So if God almighty was created by a God, you could naturally asked who or what created this God? An even *almighter* one? What about this almightier God?

*If our world sits on a big turtle, as the ancient's used to think, then what does the turtle sit on? An even bigger turtle.*

And so on. You see, this line of thinking isn't getting us anywhere.
