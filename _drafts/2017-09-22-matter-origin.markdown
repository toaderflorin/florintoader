We know for a fact that when matter meets antimatter meet they annihalte and they create energy because we see this ALL THE TIME in particle accelerators. We also know that energy can create particle-antiparticle pairs. We're also fairly sure the universe started as a very dense point of energy which expanded really fast and as it expanded, it cooled and coallesced into the particles we see. The problem is we seem to be made out of matter, not out of antimatter, so for some peculiar reason there seems to be some sort of asymmetry between the two. We'll explore where it comes from.

If've discussed symmetries at length here, make sure you read this before you proceed. Before we go any further, I need to explain two concepts, helicity and chirality.
