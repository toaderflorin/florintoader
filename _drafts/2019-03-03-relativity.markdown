In 1905, a young Albert Einstein put out a paper that he called *On The Electrodynamics Of Moving Bodies* that would forever change the way we think about space and time (no, he didn't call his work *Special Relativity*). Among other things, it says that space contracts, time dilates and even the notion of simulaneity is relative is observer dependent. Let's be serious, nobody walks around and thinks: <i>hmm, I think that if I move at a certain speed relative to the Earth, time would have to pass slower for me</i>. Yet Einstein's special theory of relativity says this absolutely must happen, it gives us the *exact rate* at which it happens, and we can also build very precie atomic clocks that can measure differences in the passage of time and they are in perfect agreement with predictions.

The notion of relativity isn't exactly new. Galileo had already introduced the concept of inertia (an object that is in motion stays in motion and an object that's stationary remains stationary, unless acted upon). He also realized that the concept of *absolute* motion is meaningless, one can only talk about motion in relation to a frame of reference. 

*Galilean relativity makes sense intuitively for most people. If I'm in a car that's moving at 100km/h and I overtake another car that's moving at 80km/h  t(relative to the road), I would perceipe the relative speed to be 20 km/h.*

Also, object trajectories are consistent:

And yet, this must be wrong. Because dropping weights from tall towers is one thing. But there was also a host of other knonw phenomena, like electricity and magnetism for example. And these phenomenons really don't play well with Gallielean relativity.

In xxx, Maxwell came up with the first unified thoery in the history of physics

Einstein wrote: 

*It is known that Maxwell's electrodynamics – as usually understood at the present time – when applied to moving bodies, leads to asymmetries which do not appear to be inherent in the phenomena. Take, for example, the reciprocal electrodynamic action of a magnet and a conductor. The observable phenomenon here depends only on the relative motion of the conductor and the magnet, whereas the customary view draws a sharp distinction between the two cases in which either the one or the other of these bodies is in motion. For if the magnet is in motion and the conductor at rest, there arises in the neighborhood of the magnet an electric field with a certain definite energy, producing a current at the places where parts of the conductor are situated. But if the magnet is stationary and the conductor in motion, no electric field arises in the neighborhood of the magnet. In the conductor, however, we find an electromotive force, to which in itself there is no corresponding energy, but which gives rise – assuming equality of relative motion in the two cases discussed – to electric currents of the same path and intensity as those produced by the electric forces in the former case.*

So in short:
 * An electric current in a wire produces a magnetic field so if we were to put a magnet next to this wire, it would have an effect on it.
 * For an observer that is moving *with* the current or charge, this charge appears to be stationary, so there is no magnetic field. But in this frame of reference, the magnet is in relative motion.
 * Since electrons are like little bar magnets (that's what electron spin is), a magnetic field creates a forces that makes these electrons move so we say it *induces* a current.

But here's the problem:

*If you move between one frame of reference and the other using Galliean coordinate transformations, it doesn't work, you get inconsistent results.*
