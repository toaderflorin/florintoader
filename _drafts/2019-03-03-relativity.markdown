In 1905, a young Albert Einstein put out a paper that he called *On The Electrodynamics Of Moving Bodies* that would forever change the way we think about space and time (no, he didn't call his work *Special Relativity*). Among other things, it says that space contracts, time dilates and even the notion of simulaneity is relative is observer dependent. Let's be serious, nobody walks around and thinks: <i>hmm, I think that if I move at a certain speed relative to the Earth, time would have to pass slower for me</i>. Yet Einstein's special theory of relativity says this absolutely must happen, it gives us the *exact rate* at which it happens, and we can also build very precie atomic clocks that can measure differences in the passage of time and they are in perfect agreement with predictions.

The notion of relativity isn't exactly new. Galileo had already introduced the concept of inertia (an object that is in motion stays in motion and an object that's stationary remains stationary, unless acted upon). He also realized that the concept of *absolute* motion is meaningless, one can only talk about motion in relation to a frame of reference. 

*Galilean relativity makes sense intuitively for most people. If I'm in a car that's moving at 100km/h and I overtake another car that's moving at 80km/h  t(relative to the road), I would perceipe the relative speed to be 20 km/h.*

And yet, this must be wrong for reasons we'll discuss.

Because dropping weights from tall towers is one thing. But there's also a host of other phenomena, like electricity for example. Then there are materials like magnetite that have strange properties like being able to affect some metals from a distance (magnetism). People had been studying electricity and magnetism for quite some time and at the end of the 19th century, quite a lot was known about them, and Maxwell realized they are two sides of the same coin. is crediting with coming up with the first unified theory in physics.

  * It was know they were related because a moving electric charge would also create a magnetic field around it.
  * A variable electric field in space creates a magnetic field.
  * A variable magnetic field generates a magnetic field.

And they realisted these objects create *force fields* around them

Maxwell even showed that they are essentially the same phenomenon, comming up with the first unification in the history of physics in the process.
