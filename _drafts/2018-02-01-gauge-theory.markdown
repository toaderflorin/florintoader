title:  "Gauge Theory"
description: "No, he's not dead, actually that's the thing-I've been thinking... people are strange beings. We neglect those around us who give use attention an love and chase the ones that don't reciprocate. Our generation discovered what a guitar virtuoso and  awesome artist Prince was after he died. Same with George Michael.
