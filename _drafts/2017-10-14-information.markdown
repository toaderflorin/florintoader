title:  "Information IS Chaos"

Riddle me this: which image do you think has more information, the one on the left or the one or the right?

## A Primer On Entropy ##
When scientists were trying to figure out what heat is, they initially envisioned it as some sort of fluid that can flow between warm objects (possessing this fluid) and cold objects , or warm parts of an object to cooler parts until the "pressure" of this fluid equalizes. Eventually they settled upon the idea that heat is actually an internal jittering motion of the constituents of matter.
