description: "
Quantum spin is something which is not easy to explain. You’d be excused if you explain it as similar to a planet rotating around its axis, but it’s not that. Quantum spin is angular momentum just like the rotating motion of a planet is angular momentum but it’s a purely quantum property.

You might have heard of a little thought experiment by Schrodinger in trying to prove the absurdity of the [Copenhagen interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_interpretation) of quantum mechanics.

Here's a description of the experiment by the man himself:

<i>
One can even set up quite ridiculous cases. A cat is penned up in a steel chamber, along with the following device (which must be secured against direct interference by the cat): in a Geiger counter, there is a tiny bit of radioactive substance, so small, that perhaps in the course of the hour one of the atoms decays, but also, with equal probability, perhaps none; if it happens, the counter tube discharges and through a relay releases a hammer that shatters a small flask of hydrocyanic acid. If one has left this entire system to itself for an hour, one would say that the cat still lives if meanwhile no atom has decayed. The first atomic decay would have poisoned it. The psi-function of the entire system would express this by having in it the living and dead cat (pardon the expression) mixed or smeared out in equal parts.
</i>

Essentially, you could write something like:

which gives equal probability amplitudes to the cat being dead or alive, and these amplitudes add up to 100%. He further goes on to say:

<i>
It is typical of these cases that an indeterminacy originally restricted to the atomic domain becomes transformed into macroscopic indeterminacy, which can then be resolved by direct observation. That prevents us from so naively accepting as valid a "blurred model" for representing reality. In itself, it would not embody anything unclear or contradictory. There is a difference between a shaky or out-of-focus photograph and a snapshot of clouds and fog banks. 
</i>

Before we discuss this in detail, we must understand some basic aspects og quantum mechanics. First of all, we know all matter, not just light is wavelike in nature.

what quantum decoherence is.
