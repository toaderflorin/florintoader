While the term *domain driven design* gets thrown around quite a bit, if you ask five different developers what they understand by DDD, you are most likely going to get five different answers. To make matters worse, even Eric Evan's book which is the canonical authority on all things DDD doesn't give an exact definition, so the term DDD is used quite loosely. It goes without saying that a thorough understanding of the business should be important for all parties involved in software development (developers, product owners, designers), sometimes there's a disconnect between the imediate goals of the people involved.

* The company as a whole must make a profit so it needs to solve certain business needs for existing and potential new customers.
* Developers are usually more interested in the technology itself, don't particularly like meetings and would like to work with the newest stacks available.
* Designers are highly creative keen to showcase their skills, but at times tend to prefer design that allows them to do it at the expense of business value.

Developers and designers of course *know* they should be focusing on business value, but it's always easier to do something else that's sexier and more interesting in the short term. At its core, DDD is a recipe (or codified prescription) for doing software development that attempts to bridge this disconnect. One way to think about DDD is that it is a top-down way of looking at the development process, in the sense that we define and codify the business requirements first and then we build on top of that. 

## Enter Event Storming
The brainchild of Alberto Brandolini, it's essentially a way for the team members to communicate ideas using sticky notes and a whiteboard. Event storming is intended to create and share a common understanding of the domain model. 

![event-storming](/images/ddd/storming3.webp){:class="img-responsive"}

It's not a replacement for a design document, flow chart, UML diagram, deployment plan, architecture diagram, or anything else related to implementation. The first step is to find the domain events and write them on orange sticky notes. When all domain events are found the second step is to find for each domain event the command that caused it. Commands are written on blue notes and placed directly before the corresponding domain event. In the third step the aggregates are identified on which the commands are executed and to which happen the domain events. The aggregates are written in yellow stickies.

## An Example
Let us imagine the following scenario -- the team is tasked with creating creating a simple e-commerce site that sales sporting apparel. DDD mandates that before we choose what technology we build the application in, whether we choose a microservice approach and before we design the UX and UI, we define the exact business objects and processes. We can identify some domain entities from the start -- users need to log in so we'll have an *Account* object and we also need multiple types of users (for example an admin and a regular customer) so we will also have a Permission object. Of course we need to have a catalogue of products what we're going to sell so we will define a *Product* object and these products have to be kept in stock so we'll have *Warehouse* and *WarehouseProuct* entries. And of course *Order*, *OrderItem* and *CardInfo*. 

We can model it like this.

## Code First?
When ORMs entered the scene, they put the concept of a model or entity at the forefront. All of a sudden developers didn't really have to concern themselves with low level database queries, join tables in case of many-to-many relations etc. We could just focus on defining the objects and the levels between them and the library would take care of the rest.

Of course, a domain expert isn't interested things like databases (SQL vs NoSQL), comunication protocols like REST or gRPC and so forth. Domain experts aren't interested necesarily in UX either, all these things come afterwards. These things pertain to *how* the business goal is achieved not to *what* the business goal is.

What we described goes by the term [Model Driven Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-driven_architecture). Domain Driven Design counts as MDA but not viceversa because  DDD is actually a bit more prescriptive and it introduces additional concepts:

* **Entities** form the basis of our domain model.
* A collection of entities that can be treated as an atomic enity form an **aggregate**.
* Service
* Entities and their associated services can be grouped into fairly isolated islands called **bounded contexts**.
* **Domain events** determine the flow of the domain in time.

*Bounded context make for good candidates for individual microservices but they don't have to be. Remember, we are using DDD to inform our technical decisions, not the other way around.*

One of the slightly overlooked benefits of DDD is that it can significantly imporive your architectural robustness your software solution. Virtually all team members of a software development team agree that properly architecting an application is extremely important -- because just like a poorly constructed building, a software project lacking a solid architectural background can easily come crashing down after a while. But unlike with buildings, because of software's fluid development nature there's always the feeling that one can build functionality poorly initially (say to meet a deadline) and then go back and change things. The problem with this line of thinking is if new functionality is built on top of existing one, this never ends up happening, so constructing a solid foundation is extremely important.

Let's consider the MVVM architectural pattern. While not applications use this exact pattern, there's usually some separation between the business logic and the domain model and what's actually shown on screen -- for example if you're fetching data in a React / Redux application, usually the model will be whatever the API returns and the frontend will keep some transformed version of this data in the local state. So what happens if we don't enforce this separation between domain models and view models? Developers end up changing the model to suit whatever needs to be shown on the screen, so we end up with a lot of hacks, temporary or computed fields, duplicate objects for the same business entity and a lot of fragmentation and corners cut in the codebase. The model should always be the primary source of truth.

Ultimately, DDD is just an approach to keep focus on the endgoal of delivering business value while maintaining a clear architecture and separation of concerns.
