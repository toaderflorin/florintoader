I"Á<p>Before getting into library-specific details, itâ€™s worth starting with a definition of what constitutes reactivity. A typical example would be an Excel spreadsheet: if a cell aggregates data from other cells, that cell instantly changes if we change a value in any of the aggregated cells. In reactive programming, if a variable A depends on B and C, a change in either B or C would also trigger a change in A. While there seems to be an ongoing debate whether React is truly reactive, thereâ€™s no doubt that the UI reacts to changes in the data model, even if parts of the model itself donâ€™t react to other parts being changed, so from now on, weâ€™ll consider this definition of reactivity.</p>
