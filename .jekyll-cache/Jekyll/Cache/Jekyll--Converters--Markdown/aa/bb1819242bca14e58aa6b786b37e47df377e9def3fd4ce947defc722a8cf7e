I"t<p>While the rumors about Redux’s demise are most likely mostly exaggerated, there is no doubt that there is no doubt we can achieve a lot of the functionality it provides with hooks. Also, as a rule of thumb, we should avoid using as many external libraries as possible because chances are they could become deprecated in the future. While using the <span class="code">useReducer</span> hook is relatively straightforward, React doesn’t provide a prescription on how to structure a relatively large application. To make matters worse, virtually every blog article on the internet recommends using a different approach.</p>
