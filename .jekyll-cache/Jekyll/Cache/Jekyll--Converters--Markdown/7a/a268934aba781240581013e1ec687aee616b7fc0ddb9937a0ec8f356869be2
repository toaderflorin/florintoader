I"N<p>In the previous example, we went over a global store app pattern that emulates Redux. The main advantage of this approach is familiarity, meaning that developers can structure their projects using a similar folder/code structure. There is, however, an alternative approach popularized by  Svelte, which is less verbose. While this is a familiar approach, many developers feel that the single-store architectural approach leads to bad software patterns. Dan Abramov has famously likened asynchronicity and state mutations, yet having a global state object can easily lead to situations where existing functionality can rely on existing state (state that was fetched previously). Moreover, oftentimes users bookmark or refresh pages, which can lead to problems.</p>

<p>Having a lot of stateful data can lead to brittle code because it relies on previously executed actions which might break the flow.</p>

<p>(As a side note here, a lot of applications are clientside logic heavy and they do a lot of inner joins and computations where this information might be better sent to the server)</p>

<p>One approach that client-side applications can borrow from server-side applications is to treat the URL as the current “state” and render solely based on that. That way, we ensure that the page always renders the same regardless of whether it was the result of client-side navigation or the user refreshing the page. An (imperfect) analogy that can be used here is that of pure functions - the result of the pure function always depends on the input parameters (in our case the URL), not some other application state. The analogy is imperfect because the page would of course render based on the server-side state.</p>

<p>React’s functional components lend themselves well to this approach. We can use a simple example: imagine a page that displays products.</p>
