I"Ý<p>Reactâ€™s development history is widely documented and was developed for internal use at Facebook, as it is the case with a lot of libraries, and for quite some time it was ES5 only â€“ ES6 support of course followed, but the team quite quickly realized that if a component doesnâ€™t need to maintain an internal state, thereâ€™s no need for it to be a class, and one of the major additions of v14.0 were stateless functional components. Not long after, the <a href="https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0">container / presentational pattern</a> appeared, where the state changes would be handled in a wrapping class component, and the inner child component would handle the presentation part.</p>
